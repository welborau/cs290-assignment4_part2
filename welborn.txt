Task: Had an extremely difficult time using POST and mySQL together to get the variables separately then finding a way to delete each row correctly since it would delete the most recent row, not the row that I want it to delete specifically.  The videos and material online aren't very clear on how to really use them all together.  I did my best with what I could do, but couldn't get the add function to work correctly.

P.S.  I couldn't get my .gitignore file to hide my storedInfo.php (which has my password) correctly. :(
