Task: Had an extremely difficult time using POST and mySQL together to get the variables separately then finding a way to delete each row correctly since it would delete the most recent row, not the row that I want it to delete specifically.  The videos and material online aren't very clear on how to really use them all together.  I did my best with what I could do, but couldn't get the add function to work correctly.

P.S.  I couldn't get my .gitignore file to hide my storedInfo.php (which has my password) correctly. :(

Task: Worked on the php file with father, whom has programming experience, modifying each function and all that.  BUt we got stuck at some point which can be showned in datStorage.php.  We decided to ask my brother whom does web development for a living and I was shocked to find I had approached this program incorrectly because php files are server only, so I decided to make a new file called betterStorage.php which was uploaded on github, which works WAY better now, just few more functions to work on.
